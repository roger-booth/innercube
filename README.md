operate an array of Rubik's cubes

Milestone reached 5/3/2014
 Working high-level model.
 Create an entanglement of eight Rubik's cubes.
 An operation on the face of one cube is entangled with a sister operation
 of the same face on another cube.
 The primary operation is split into two secondary operations using channels.
 Secondary operations are performed by loading the face and edges of the affected
 cubes into a ring structure, where rotations are performed.
 Results of the rotation are unloaded back into the affected cubes.
 
Next milestone
  3D display of the current model in the browser.
    Will use AngularJS and HTML5 Canvas
