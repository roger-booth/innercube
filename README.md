operate an array of Rubik's cubes

Milestone reached 5/3/2014<br>
 Working high-level model.<br>
 Create an entanglement of eight Rubik's cubes, operated by multiple players.<br>
 An operation on the face of one cube is entangled with a sister operation<br>
 of the same face on another cube.<br>
 The primary operation is split into two secondary operations using channels.<br>
 Secondary operations are performed by loading the face and edges of the affected<br>
 cubes into a ring structure, where rotations are performed.<br>
 Results of the rotation are unloaded back into the affected cubes.<br>
